# Enrichment Refresh Script Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the `enrichment_refresh.py` script to provide comprehensive tracking and monitoring of all enrichment services, not just VirusTotal file analysis.

## What Enrichments Are Handled

The `EnrichmentService` handles multiple types of enrichment:

### Session Enrichments (IP-based)
1. **DShield** - IP to ASN and geo data lookup
   - Provides ASN (Autonomous System Number)
   - Provides country/geo location data
   - Requires `dshield_email` configuration

2. **URLHaus** - IP reputation data
   - Provides threat intelligence on IP addresses
   - Requires `urlhaus_api` configuration

3. **SPUR** - Additional IP intelligence
   - Provides enhanced IP analysis
   - Requires `spur_api` configuration

### File Enrichments (Hash-based)
1. **VirusTotal** - File analysis and reputation
   - Provides malware detection results
   - Provides file classification and threat labels
   - Requires `vt_api` configuration

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Status Reporting
**Before**: Only showed basic progress (sessions_processed, files_processed)

**After**: Detailed enrichment statistics in status files:
```json
{
  "sessions_processed": 150,
  "files_processed": 38,
  "enrichment_stats": {
    "dshield_calls": 120,
    "urlhaus_calls": 95,
    "spur_calls": 88,
    "virustotal_calls": 38,
    "dshield_failures": 2,
    "urlhaus_failures": 0,
    "spur_failures": 1,
    "virustotal_failures": 0
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Console Output
**Before**: Basic progress messages
```
[sessions] committed 100 rows (elapsed 15.2s)
```

**After**: Detailed enrichment statistics
```
Available enrichment services: DShield (IP→ASN/Geo), URLHaus (IP reputation), VirusTotal (file analysis)
[sessions] committed 100 rows (elapsed 15.2s) [dshield=95, urlhaus=88, spur=82]
[files] committed 25 rows (elapsed 8.1s) [vt=25]
```

### 3. Real-time Enrichment Tracking
- **New Function**: `track_enrichment_stats()` - Analyzes enrichment results and counts successful calls
- **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between successful enrichments and failures
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tracks all four enrichment services

### 4. Service Availability Logging
The script now shows which enrichment services are configured and available:
```
Available enrichment services: DShield (IP→ASN/Geo), URLHaus (IP reputation), VirusTotal (file analysis)
```

Or warns if none are configured:
```
Warning: No enrichment services configured - only database updates will be performed
```

## How It Works

### Session Processing
For each session, the script calls:
```python
result = service.enrich_session(session_id, src_ip)
```

This automatically triggers enrichment for:
- **DShield** (if `dshield_email` configured)
- **URLHaus** (if `urlhaus_api` configured) 
- **SPUR** (if `spur_api` configured)

### File Processing
For each file, the script calls:
```python
result = service.enrich_file(file_hash, filename)
```

This automatically triggers:
- **VirusTotal** enrichment (if `vt_api` configured)

### Statistics Tracking
The `track_enrichment_stats()` function analyzes each enrichment result:
- **DShield**: Checks for `asn` field presence
- **URLHaus**: Checks for non-empty string data
- **SPUR**: Checks for non-empty array data
- **VirusTotal**: Checks for valid response structure

## Status File Monitoring

The enhanced status files can be monitored with `monitor_progress.py` and will show:

```
[enrichment_refresh] enrichment_refresh sessions=150/1000 files=38/500
  dshield=120 urlhaus=95 spur=88 vt=38
```

## Configuration Requirements

To enable different enrichment services, configure in `sensors.toml`:

```toml
[sensors.default]
dshield_email = "your-email@domain.com"
urlhaus_api = "your-urlhaus-api-key"
spur_api = "your-spur-api-key"
vt_api = "your-virustotal-api-key"
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: See exactly which enrichment services are being used
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track success/failure rates for each service
3. **Real-time Updates**: Status files update every 10 items or 30 seconds
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all available enrichment types
5. **Better Debugging**: Clear indication of which services are configured and working

## Example Usage

```bash
# Run enrichment refresh with monitoring
uv run scripts/enrichment_refresh.py --cache-dir /mnt/dshield/data/cache --sessions 100 --files 50

# In another terminal, monitor progress
python3 monitor_progress.py
```

## Expected Output

```
Available enrichment services: DShield (IP→ASN/Geo), URLHaus (IP reputation), VirusTotal (file analysis)
[sessions] committed 100 rows (elapsed 15.2s) [dshield=95, urlhaus=88, spur=82]
[files] committed 25 rows (elapsed 8.1s) [vt=25]
```

The script now provides comprehensive tracking of all enrichment services, giving you complete visibility into what enrichments are being performed and how successfully they're working.
