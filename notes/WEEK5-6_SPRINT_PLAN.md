**Date Created**: October 25, 2025 (Day 20)
**Project**: cowrieprocessor - Test Coverage Campaign
**Sprint Duration**: 8-10 days (Days 21-28)
**Primary Goal**: Achieve 65% minimum CI coverage + Fix all broken tests

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: 58% coverage, 89 broken tests
**CI Requirement**: 65% minimum (HARD GATE, BLOCKING)
**Gap**: -7 percentage points + 89 test failures
**Strategy**: Week 5 coverage sprint (58% → 65.5%) + Week 6 test fixes

- **Week 6**: Systematic test fixes, comprehensive verification
- **Success Criteria**: CI gate passes (65%+) + clean test suite

---

## Week 5: Coverage Sprint (Days 21-25)

**Target**: 58% → 65.5% (+7.5%, ~770 statements)
**Daily Goal**: +1.5% per day (3-4 small modules)
**Strategy**: Small module targeting (100-300 statements per module)
**Quality Standard**: Maintain 100% test pass rate on new tests

### Day 21: Enrichment Module Focus (+1.5%)

**Target Modules**:

1. **hibp_client.py** (68 statements, 0% → 75%)
   - Current: 0 statements covered
   - Target: +51 statements covered
   - Expected tests: 15-18 tests
   - Focus: HIBP API integration, k-anonymity protocol, cache handling

   - Current: 39 statements covered
   - Target: +31 statements covered
   - Expected tests: 8-10 tests
   - Focus: Quota tracking, rate limit management, API throttling

**Combined Impact**: +168 statements = ~+1.64% project coverage
**Test Count**: ~45 tests
**Time Estimate**: 8-9 hours

---

### Day 22: CLI Utilities & Handlers (+1.5%)

**Target Modules**:

1. **enrich_passwords.py** (672 statements, 0% → 25%)
   - Current: 0 statements covered (likely underreported, check actual)
   - Target: +168 statements covered
   - Expected tests: 30-35 tests
   - Focus: Password enrichment CLI, HIBP integration, top passwords report

**Risk**: enrich_passwords.py is large (672 statements), may need strategic subset

**Alternative if enrich_passwords.py too large**:
- Replace with 3-4 smaller modules from loader/ or utils/
- Maintain small module strategy (<300 statements per module)

---

### Day 23: Loader & Processing Modules (+1.5%) + Phase 3 Refactor Completion

**ACTUAL WORK COMPLETED** (2025-10-25):

**Phase 3 Refactoring Completion**:
- Completed Phases 1-3 of codebase modernization (16 commits)
- Phase 1: Broke dependency cycles, migrated utilities to package structure (commit da40dc7)
- Phase 2: Modernized orchestrate_sensors.py to use cowrie-loader CLI (commits 7343d7f, b7dbf81, 5814686)
- Phase 3: Archived legacy code to archive/ directory (commit 41fe59b)
- Configuration cleanup: Moved sensors.toml to config/ directory (commits 383c63b, 6bc1160)
- Updated 8 CLI tools to use config/ path with fallback for backward compatibility

**Test Suite Status After Refactoring**:
- **Total Test Files**: 1,075 tests collected (pre-refactor baseline)
- **Import Errors**: 13 test files fail due to archived legacy modules:
  1. `enrichment_handlers` - moved to archive/ (was root-level)
  2. `process_cowrie` - moved to archive/ (was root-level)
  3. `refresh_cache_and_reports` - moved to archive/ (was root-level)
  4. `secrets_resolver` - migrated to cowrieprocessor/utils/secrets.py
  5. `session_enumerator` - migrated to cowrieprocessor/loader/session_parser.py

**Legacy Test Files Requiring Update** (13 files):
- Integration tests (5): test_enrichment_flow.py, test_enrichment_integration.py, test_process_cowrie_sqlalchemy2.py, test_refresh_cache_sqlalchemy2.py, test_virustotal_integration.py
- Unit tests (8): test_enrichment_handlers.py, test_process_cowrie.py, test_process_cowrie_simple.py, test_process_cowrie_types.py, test_refresh_cache_simple.py, test_refresh_cache_types.py, test_secrets_resolver.py, test_session_enumerator.py

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. **Option A** (Quick Fix): Update test imports to use new module paths:
   - `secrets_resolver` → `cowrieprocessor.utils.secrets`
   - `session_enumerator` → `cowrieprocessor.loader.session_parser`
   - Mark archive tests as deprecated/skipped
2. **Option B** (Long Term): Rewrite tests for new ORM-based architecture
3. **Recommended**: Option A for immediate CI unblocking, Option B in future sprint

**Impact on Coverage**:
- Modern codebase tests: Running (results pending)
- Legacy tests excluded: ~13 test files (~200-300 tests estimated)
- Expected passing tests: 900-1,000+ tests (verification in progress)

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete test suite run (excluding legacy tests)
2. Document passing test count and any real failures
3. Update legacy test imports or mark as deprecated
4. Push 16 commits to remote branch

**Target Modules** (DEFERRED to next sprint):

1. **dlq_processor.py** (estimated ~200 statements, baseline TBD)
   - Status: Partially tested during refactor
   - New tests added: test_dlq_processor.py (untracked)

2. **cowrie_schema.py** (estimated ~150 statements, baseline TBD)
   - Status: Covered by loader tests

3. **Smaller utility modules** (batch of 2-3 from utils/)
   - Status: Some covered by refactor testing

**Note**: Day 23 pivoted to complete Phase 3 refactoring and establish CI-ready baseline

---

### Day 24: Reporting & Analysis Modules (+1.5%)

**Target Modules**:

1. **dal.py** (reporting data access layer, size TBD)
   - Focus: Report aggregations, data queries, statistics generation
   - Expected tests: 20-25 tests
   - Target: +150 statements covered

2. **builders.py** (report structure builders, size TBD)
   - Focus: Report JSON/HTML generation, structure assembly
   - Expected tests: 15-20 tests
   - Target: +100 statements covered

3. **Additional analyze.py coverage** (512 total, currently 65%)
   - Current: ~333 statements covered
   - Target: 65% → 80% (+77 statements)
   - Expected tests: 15-18 tests

**Combined Impact**: +327 statements = ~+3.19% project coverage
**Test Count**: ~55 tests
**Time Estimate**: 8-9 hours

**Note**: Need to get actual statement counts for dal.py and builders.py

---

### Day 25: Final Coverage Push & Buffer (+1.5%)

## Risk Assessment & Contingencies

### Risk 1: Coverage Target Not Reached by Day 25
**Probability**: Low (strategy proven in Week 4)
**Impact**: High (CI gate blocks merge)

**Contingency**:
- Day 25 buffer day can absorb up to 2% shortfall
- Days 26-27 mornings can add 0.5-1% if needed
- Day 28 can be extended to Day 29 if critical

**Mitigation**: Daily coverage checks, adjust module selection if behind pace

---

### Risk 2: Test Fixes Break Existing Coverage
**Probability**: Medium (refactoring can remove covered code)
**Impact**: High (regression toward CI gate)

**Contingency**:
- Run coverage report after each category of fixes
- If regression detected, add coverage tests before continuing
- Maintain 1-2% buffer above 65% threshold

**Mitigation**: Fix tests without refactoring production code when possible

---

### Risk 3: Underestimated Test Fix Complexity
**Probability**: Medium (89 failures = unknown root causes)
**Impact**: Medium (delays Day 28 completion)

**Contingency**:
- Day 28 can extend to Day 29-30 if needed
- Focus on high-impact categories first (types, DB)
- Defer low-priority miscellaneous tests if time-constrained

**Mitigation**: Day 26 morning: Full categorization and priority assessment

---

### Risk 4: Large Module Strategy Required for Coverage
**Probability**: Low (plenty of small modules available)
**Impact**: Medium (lower efficiency, more time required)

**Contingency**:
- Days 22-23 have large module backups (enrich_passwords.py)
- Can target specific high-value functions in large modules
- Day 25 buffer can absorb efficiency loss

**Mitigation**: Maintain small module (<300 statements) focus through Day 24

---

---

## Strategic Principles (Week 4 Validated)

### 1. Small Module Focus (MANDATORY)
- **Target**: 100-300 statements per module
- **Avoid**: Modules >800 statements (Day 18 lesson)
- **ROI**: Small modules deliver 3-4x better project coverage impact
- **Efficiency**: 1.5-2.0 statements covered per test

### 2. Quality Over Speed
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (no flaky tests, no technical debt)
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings, Given-When-Then
- **Type Safety**: Full annotations, mypy passing
- **Real Fixtures**: tmp_path, real DBs (no mocking own code)

### 3. Daily Coverage Verification
- **Check Coverage**: After every test file completion
- **Verify Impact**: Confirm project % increase matches expectations
- **Adjust Strategy**: If behind pace, reduce test depth or switch modules

### 4. Strategic Module Selection
- **Prioritize**: 0% baseline modules (maximum impact potential)
- **Target**: 30-50% coverage modules (high ROI)
- **Optimize**: Push 60-75% modules to 85%+ only if time permits
- **Skip**: 85%+ modules (diminishing returns)

### 5. Test Pattern Consistency
- **Structure**: Given-When-Then comments in docstrings and code
- **Fixtures**: Prefer pytest fixtures over manual setup
- **Assertions**: Clear, specific (not generic "assert result")
- **Error Testing**: Always include error path tests

## Appendix B: Coverage Calculation Reference

**Project Total**: 10,239 statements (Day 20 baseline)

**Coverage Percentage Formula**:
```
Coverage % = (Covered Statements / Total Statements) * 100
Project Impact = (Statements Added / 10,239) * 100
```

**Examples**:
- +100 statements covered = +0.98% project coverage
- +150 statements covered = +1.47% project coverage
- +200 statements covered = +1.95% project coverage

**Week 5 Target Calculation**:
```
Current: 58% = 5,939 statements covered
Target: 65.5% = 6,707 statements covered
Needed: +768 statements covered
Daily: 768 / 5 days = 153.6 statements per day
```

**Module Contribution Examples**:
- Module A: 100 statements, 0% → 75% = +75 statements = +0.73%
- Module B: 200 statements, 50% → 80% = +60 statements = +0.59%
- Combined: +135 statements = +1.32% project coverage
