**Documented In**: notes/UNICODE_CONTROL_CHAR_SOLUTION.md, notes/UNICODE_CLEANUP_UTILITY.md

---

## Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Test Isolation Pattern
**Pattern**: Each test creates isolated temporary database

```python
def _make_engine(tmp_path: Path) -> Engine:
    """Create test database engine with full schema."""
    db_path = tmp_path / "test.sqlite"
    settings = DatabaseSettings(url=f"sqlite:///{db_path}")
    engine = create_engine_from_settings(settings)
    apply_migrations(engine)
    return engine

def test_feature(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    """Test feature with isolated database."""
    engine = _make_engine(tmp_path)
    # Test implementation
```

**Benefits**:
- No shared state between tests
- Parallel test execution safe
- Clean setup/teardown
- Realistic integration testing

**Established**: Week 1, refined Week 2-3
**Usage**: All database-related tests (100+ tests)

---

### 2. Complex Test Data Pattern
**Pattern**: Helper fixtures create interconnected test data

```python
def _create_test_keys(session: Session) -> None:
    """Create comprehensive test SSH key intelligence data.

    Creates:
    - Campaign 1: key1 + key2 (RSA, high usage, strong association)
    - Campaign 2: key3 (Ed25519, moderate usage)
    - Isolated: key4 (RSA, low usage, no associations)
    - 5 session associations for key1 and key2
    - 1 key association between key1 and key2
    """
    # Complex fixture implementation
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests reflect real-world scenarios
- Multiple campaigns/patterns in one fixture
- Association graphs properly constructed
- Edge cases naturally included

**Established**: Week 3 Day 14 (SSH key analytics)
**Usage**: Graph algorithm tests, campaign detection tests

---

### 3. Idempotency Testing Pattern
**Pattern**: Verify operations can be safely re-run

```python
def test_migration_is_idempotent(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    """Test migration can be safely re-run.

    Given: Database at version N-1
    When: Migration applied twice
    Then: Schema correct, no errors on second run
    """
    engine = _make_engine_with_base_schema(tmp_path)

    # First run
    _upgrade_to_vX(engine)

    # Second run should not raise
    _upgrade_to_vX(engine)

    # Verify schema unchanged
    assert _table_exists(engine, "expected_table")
```

**Benefits**:
- Safe deployment of migrations
- Handles interrupted migrations
- Prevents data corruption

**Established**: Week 3 Day 13 (migrations testing)
**Usage**: All migration tests (35 tests)

---

### 4. No Mocking Own Code Policy
**Pattern**: Only mock external dependencies, use real implementations for own code

**What We Mock**:
- External API clients (VirusTotal, HIBP, DShield)
- Network operations
- File system operations (when testing logic, not I/O)

**What We Don't Mock**:
- Database operations (use real SQLite with tmp_path)
- ORM models and queries
- Internal business logic
- Data processing pipelines

**Benefits**:
- Tests catch real bugs (discovered SSH key analytics bug)
- Integration testing by default
- Refactoring safe (tests use public APIs)
- High confidence in test results

**Established**: Week 1, strictly enforced Week 2-3
**Result**: Discovered production bug in ssh_key_analytics.py:409

---

### 5. Given-When-Then Docstring Pattern
**Pattern**: Structured test documentation

```python
def test_campaign_detection_with_related_keys(tmp_path: Path) -> None:
    """Test campaign identification detects related keys via associations.

    Given: Database with 2 related keys (key1, key2) sharing:
           - 5 session co-occurrences
           - 1 direct association record
           - Common command patterns
    When: identify_campaigns() called with min_confidence=0.3
    Then: Returns 1 campaign containing both keys
          Campaign confidence > 0.3
          Campaign has correct key count
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear test intent
- Easy to understand test scenarios
- Maintainable documentation
- Supports test review

**Established**: Week 2, mandatory Week 3
**Usage**: All new tests (140+ tests)

---

## Production Issues Discovered

### 1. SSH Key Analytics - unique_ips Never Populated (Week 3 Day 14)
**Location**: `cowrieprocessor/enrichment/ssh_key_analytics.py:409`
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Documented, scheduled for future fix

**Issue**:
```python
# In _find_connected_campaigns method:
unique_ips: set[str] = set()  # BUG: Initialized but never populated!

# Later at line 447:
if campaign.unique_ips >= min_ips:  # Always fails if min_ips > 0
    valid_campaigns.append(campaign)
```

**Impact**:
- Campaign detection effectiveness reduced
- Campaigns rejected when `min_ips > 0` parameter used
- Confidence scoring always gets `ip_spread=0`
- Campaigns with good key diversity can be missed

**Workaround**:
- Use `min_ips=0` in campaign detection calls
- Or use lower confidence thresholds

**Recommended Fix**:
```python
# Should populate unique_ips from session data:
for key_id in component:
    sessions = session.query(SessionSSHKeys).filter_by(ssh_key_id=key_id).all()
    for s in sessions:
        if s.source_ip:
            unique_ips.add(s.source_ip)
```

**Discovery Method**: Comprehensive test suite with real database fixtures
**Documented In**: notes/DAY14_SSH_ANALYTICS_SUMMARY.md, notes/WEEK3_SUMMARY.md

---

### 2. Database Model Field Mismatches (Week 2 Days 8-9)
**Severity**: Low (test failures, not production)
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

**Issues Discovered**:
- `sensor_id` not valid for SessionSummary model
- `execution_count` should be `occurrences` for CommandStat
- `analysis_results` required (not nullable) for LongtailAnalysis

**Root Cause**: Tests assumed field names without verifying against actual ORM models

**Resolution**:
- Verify model definitions in `db/models.py` before writing tests
- Added validation step to test development workflow

**Lesson**: Always check ORM model definitions before writing tests

**Documented In**: notes/WEEK2_SUMMARY.md

---

### 3. Coverage Measurement Error (Week 2 Day 7-8)
**Severity**: Low (measurement issue, not code bug)
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

**Issue**: Using partial test file lists showed Week 1 modules at 0% coverage

**Wrong Command**:
```bash
# WRONG - only tests specific files
pytest tests/unit/test_longtail.py tests/unit/test_dlq_processor.py ...
```

**Correct Command**:
```bash
# CORRECT - tests entire unit/ directory
rm -f .coverage
uv run coverage run --source=cowrieprocessor -m pytest tests/unit/
```

**Impact**: Temporary confusion about coverage metrics

**Resolution**: Established mandatory coverage measurement protocol

**Documented In**: notes/WEEK2_SUMMARY.md
