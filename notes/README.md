---

## File Maintenance Guidelines

### When adding new notes:

1. **Daily progress**: Update active project files or create temporary working notes
2. **Completed work**: Update `committed-notes.md` with significant achievements
3. **Issues discovered**: Add to `tech-debt.md` immediately
4. **Feature docs**: Create feature-specific .md files as needed
5. **Cleanup**: Remove obsolete working notes quarterly

### Naming conventions:

- Weekly summaries: `WEEK<n>_SUMMARY.md`
- Daily/feature summaries: `DAY<n>_<TOPIC>_SUMMARY.md`
- Coverage tracking: `coverage_<type>_<checkpoint>.txt`
- Issue plans: `issue-<n>-plan.md`
- Feature docs: `<FEATURE_NAME>_<TYPE>.md`

## Contributing to Notes

### Best Practices:

1. **Keep it organized**: Use existing categories, create new ones if needed
2. **Update master docs**: Always update `committed-notes.md` when completing significant work
3. **Track issues**: Add discovered issues to `tech-debt.md` immediately
4. **Clean regularly**: Remove obsolete working notes quarterly
5. **Summarize**: Create summaries instead of keeping all daily progress files

### Quarterly Cleanup Checklist:

- [ ] Archive completed work summaries (>6 months old)
- [ ] Remove obsolete working notes and daily progress files
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect current structure
- [ ] Review implementation docs for archival candidates
- [ ] Consolidate coverage data (keep final snapshots only)
