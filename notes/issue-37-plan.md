# Issue #37 Implementation Plan: Session Summaries Rebuild Script

## Overview
**Problem**: Session summaries table is not being correctly populated during bulk/delta loading process. The upsert logic in `BulkLoader._upsert_session_summaries()` is failing to properly aggregate session data, resulting in missing or incorrect session statistics.

**Impact**: All downstream reporting and analysis is broken, including MCP statistics, snowshoe/longtail detection, and enrichment linkage.

- üîÑ **ACTIVE**: Phase 7 (Monitoring and Prevention) - implementing safeguards

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Script Creation ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Objective**: Create the rebuild script as specified in the issue.

**Tasks**:
- ‚úÖ Create `scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py`
- ‚úÖ Implement `SessionSummaryRebuilder` class
- ‚úÖ Add command-line interface with argparse
- ‚úÖ Implement dry-run mode for validation
- ‚úÖ Add progress tracking with tqdm
- ‚úÖ Support incremental rebuilds by date ranges
- ‚úÖ Preserve existing enrichment data when possible
- ‚úÖ Add command_stats rebuild functionality
- ‚úÖ Memory-efficient chunked processing
- ‚úÖ Real-time telemetry integration

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py` (NEW)

**Dependencies**:
- `sqlalchemy` for database operations
- `tqdm` for progress tracking
- `cowrieprocessor.db` models
- `cowrieprocessor.settings` for database configuration

### Phase 2: Validation and Testing
**Objective**: Ensure the rebuild script works correctly and safely.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test on sample data (1000 sessions)
- [ ] Validate counts match exactly between raw_events and session_summaries
- [ ] Test with enrichment preservation enabled/disabled
- [ ] Test incremental rebuild functionality
- [ ] Performance test on 1GB subset
- [ ] Add unit tests for the rebuild script
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Validate current state
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --validate-only

# Dry run rebuild
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --dry-run

# Test incremental rebuild
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --start-date "2025-09-21T00:00:00"
```

### Phase 3: Root Cause Fix ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Objective**: Fix the underlying issue in the bulk loader.

**Tasks**:
- ‚úÖ Analyze `BulkLoader._upsert_session_summaries()` method
- ‚úÖ Identify race conditions in upsert logic
- ‚úÖ Fix JSON field extraction issues
- ‚úÖ Correct timezone handling for timestamp comparisons
- ‚úÖ Fix transaction boundary issues
- ‚úÖ Fix boolean field handling (was converting to int instead of boolean)
- ‚úÖ Fix field name mismatch (`highest_risk` vs `risk_score`)
- ‚úÖ Add row-level locking for non-SQLite/PostgreSQL databases

**Key Fixes Applied**:
1. **Boolean Field Handling**: Changed `int(agg.vt_flagged)` to `agg.vt_flagged` to preserve boolean type
2. **Field Name Correction**: Fixed `risk_score` field mapping from `highest_risk`
3. **Race Condition Mitigation**: Added `SELECT FOR UPDATE` locking for other database types
4. **Upsert Logic**: Improved fallback upsert mechanism for non-SQLite/PostgreSQL databases

**Files Modified**:
- `cowrieprocessor/loader/bulk.py` - Fixed upsert logic and boolean handling
- `scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py` - Already working correctly

**Impact**: These fixes should prevent the original data corruption issues that caused the session summary problems.

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
**Objective**: Safely deploy the fix to production.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Backup the 39GB database
- [ ] Run validation to assess current damage
- [ ] Execute rebuild script on production database
- [ ] Validate results post-rebuild
- [ ] Monitor system health during and after rebuild
- [ ] Rollback plan if issues arise

**Production Commands**:
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always specify the production database path explicitly!
# NOTE: Long-running commands (>1 hour) require explicit authorization

# Validate current state
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --validate-only --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Sample events for verification (run during rebuild to check progress)
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --sample-events 1000 --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Memory-efficient dry run (safe test with memory monitoring)
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --dry-run --batch-size 5000 --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Rebuild command_stats table (fixed command extraction logic)
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --fix-command-stats --batch-size 5000 --memory-limit 4096 --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Full rebuild with memory management (after backup!)
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --batch-size 5000 --memory-limit 4096 --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Validate after rebuild
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --validate-only --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"
```

### Phase 5: Telemetry Integration & Monitoring
**Objective**: Integrate rebuild tooling with existing observability infrastructure.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate with StatusEmitter for JSON file status updates
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry spans for distributed tracing
- [ ] Emit periodic progress updates during rebuild operations
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards to track rebuild operations
- [ ] Add alerting for rebuild failures or anomalies

**Status Files Created**:
- `/mnt/dshield/data/logs/status/rebuild_session_summaries.json` - Real-time progress
- `/mnt/dshield/data/logs/status/status.json` - Aggregated status across all phases

**OpenTelemetry Integration**:
- Spans created for major operations (`rebuild_session_summaries`, `rebuild_command_stats`)
- Attributes include batch size, memory limits, operation type
- Exception handling with proper span status updates

### Phase 6: Data Quality Investigation
**Objective**: Investigate and resolve data quality issues discovered during rebuild.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Analyze session discrepancy (-24,273 sessions in summaries vs raw_events)
- [ ] Investigate 10% data integrity issues in sampled sessions
- [ ] Identify root cause of count mismatches
- [ ] Determine if session summaries need cleanup or correction
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Command extraction logic (was looking at wrong payload field)
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations for data quality improvements

**Investigation Commands**:
```bash
# Deep dive into problematic sessions
uv run python scripts/rebuild_session_summaries.py --sample-events 1000 --db "sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite"

# Check specific problematic sessions
uv run python -c "
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, select, func
from cowrieprocessor.db import SessionSummary, RawEvent

engine = create_engine('sqlite:////mnt/dshield/data/db/cowrieprocessor.sqlite')
with engine.connect() as conn:
    # Check the problematic sessions from validation
    for session_id in ['00003ce0eb47', '0001acdc26a8']:
        raw_count = conn.execute(
            select(func.count()).select_from(RawEvent)
            .where(RawEvent.session_id == session_id)
        ).scalar_one()
        
        summary_count = conn.execute(
            select(SessionSummary.event_count)
            .where(SessionSummary.session_id == session_id)
        ).scalar_one()
        
        print(f'Session {session_id}: Raw={raw_count}, Summary={summary_count}')
"
```

### Phase 7: Monitoring and Prevention
**Objective**: Prevent future occurrences of this issue.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add daily validation job for session consistency
- [ ] Implement alerts if session counts diverge
- [ ] Add integration tests for session building process
- [ ] Enhance logging for upsert operations
- [ ] Document the issue and solution for future reference

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `scripts/daily_session_validation.py` (NEW)
- `cowrieprocessor/loader/bulk.py` - Enhanced logging
- `docs/session_summaries_rebuild.md` (NEW)
