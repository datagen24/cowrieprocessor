# Longtail Vector Storage & Historical Analysis - Complete Implementation

## Problem Solved

You identified that `command_sequence_vectors` and `behavioral_vectors` tables were not being populated, which prevented:
- Long-range threat detection analysis
- Historical data analysis for reporting
- Future use cases like snowshoe analysis
- Quick access to reports for common time windows

## Root Cause Analysis

The vector storage was failing due to:
1. **Invalid IP Address**: `source_ip` was set to `"unknown"` but PostgreSQL's `INET` type requires valid IP addresses
2. **Missing Source IP Extraction**: The logic to extract source IPs from session enrichment data was incomplete
3. **No Batch Processing**: No tools existed to populate historical data efficiently

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… 1. Fixed Vector Storage Issues

**File**: `cowrieprocessor/threat_detection/storage.py`

**Changes**:
- Fixed `source_ip` handling to use `127.0.0.1` for unknown IPs instead of `"unknown"`
- Improved source IP extraction from session enrichment data
- Added better error handling for IP address validation

**Result**: Vector storage now works correctly without PostgreSQL `INET` type errors.

### âœ… 2. Added Batch Processing to `cowrie-analyze longtail`

**File**: `cowrieprocessor/cli/analyze.py`

**Features**:
- Process historical data in configurable batch sizes
- Support for multiple time period formats:
  - Date ranges: `--start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-12-31`
  - Quarters: `--quarters Q12024 Q22024 Q32024 Q42024`
  - Months: `--months 2024-01 2024-02 2024-03`
- Dry-run mode to preview processing
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Configurable batch sizes (default: 30 days)

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Process entire year in 30-day batches
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-12-31

# Process specific quarters
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --quarters Q12024 Q22024 Q32024 Q42024

# Process specific months
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --months 2024-01 2024-02 2024-03

# Dry run to see what would be processed
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --quarters Q12024 --dry-run

# Custom batch size (days)
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --quarters Q12024 --batch-days 14
```

### âœ… 3. Added Reporting to `cowrie-report longtail`

**File**: `cowrieprocessor/cli/report.py`

**Features**:
- Quick access to common time windows
- Multiple output formats (JSON, table, text)
- Configurable threat analysis
- Vector statistics
- Trend data visualization

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Last week summary
uv run cowrie-report longtail last-week

# Last month with top threats
uv run cowrie-report longtail last-month --threats

# Q4 2024 analysis in JSON format
uv run cowrie-report longtail Q42024 --format json --threats --vectors

# January 2024 trends
uv run cowrie-report longtail 2024-01 --trends

# Save report to file
uv run cowrie-report longtail last-week --threats --output weekly_report.json
```

### âœ… 4. Created Comprehensive Reporting Queries

## Historical Data Population Strategy

### Phase 1: Batch Processing Setup
```bash
# Process 2024 data in quarterly batches
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --quarters Q12024 Q22024 Q32024 Q42024

# Process 2023 data in monthly batches
uv run cowrie-analyze longtail --batch-mode --months 2023-01 2023-02 2023-03 2023-04 2023-05 2023-06 2023-07 2023-08 2023-09 2023-10 2023-11 2023-12
