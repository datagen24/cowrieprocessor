# Quality Gate Strategy:
# - Production code (cowrieprocessor/, scripts/production/): STRICT - ruff/format must pass
# - Tests/Archive/Docs (tests/, archive/, docs/): ADVISORY - ruff/format soft-fail only
# - MyPy: STRICT - all code must pass type checking
# - Coverage: STRICT - 65% minimum coverage required
