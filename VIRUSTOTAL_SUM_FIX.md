# VirusTotal Sum Operation Fix

## Issue
After implementing the serialization fix for WhistleBlowerDict objects, a new error occurred:

```
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'dict'
```

This error appeared in `scripts/enrichment_refresh.py` when trying to sum the values from `last_analysis_stats`.

## Root Cause
The serialization fix converts vt-py objects (including nested WhistleBlowerDict objects) to their dictionary representations. However, some code was expecting all values in `last_analysis_stats` to be numeric and was using `sum(dict.values())` without checking value types.

When a nested dictionary was present in the stats, the `sum()` operation would fail trying to add an integer and a dictionary.

## Solution
Updated all code that sums dictionary values to filter for numeric types only:

### Before (Problematic Code)
```python
# This would fail if any value is a dict
vt_total = sum(last_analysis.values()) if isinstance(last_analysis, dict) else 0
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
# Sum only numeric values, skip any dict values
if isinstance(last_analysis, dict):
    vt_total = sum(
        value for value in last_analysis.values() 
        if isinstance(value, (int, float))
    )
else:
    vt_total = 0
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/enrichment_refresh.py` (Line 181-188)
Fixed the calculation of `vt_total` to only sum numeric values:

```python
# Sum only numeric values from last_analysis, skip any dict values
if isinstance(last_analysis, dict):
    vt_total = sum(
        value for value in last_analysis.values() 
        if isinstance(value, (int, float))
    )
else:
    vt_total = 0
```

### 2. `cowrieprocessor/enrichment/virustotal_handler.py` (Line 275)
Fixed the `extract_analysis_stats()` method to only sum numeric values:

```python
"total_scans": sum(v for v in stats.values() if isinstance(v, (int, float))) if stats else 0,
```

## Testing
Added a new test to verify the fix works correctly with non-numeric values:

**Test:** `test_extract_analysis_stats_with_non_numeric_values`
- Creates a `last_analysis_stats` dict with both numeric and non-numeric values
- Verifies that `total_scans` correctly sums only the numeric values
- Confirms that nested dictionaries don't break the sum operation

**Results:** All 28 tests pass, including the new test.

## Why This Happened
The serialization fix was designed to handle all types of vt-py objects, including nested structures. While this is correct for serialization, it introduced a new edge case where code expecting only numeric values in stats dictionaries could encounter nested dictionaries.

## Prevention
The fix is defensive programming that:
1. Filters for numeric types before summing
2. Handles both `int` and `float` types
3. Gracefully handles empty or malformed dictionaries
4. Doesn't break existing functionality

## Related Issues
- Original issue: WhistleBlowerDict JSON serialization error
- This issue: Sum operation on serialized dictionaries
- Both are now resolved

## Impact
- **Positive:** Code is now more robust and handles edge cases better
- **Negative:** Slightly more complex sum operations (negligible performance impact)
- **Compatibility:** Fully backward compatible with existing cached data

## Recommendations
1. **Code Review**: Check other code that processes VirusTotal responses for similar patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Consider adding type hints and validation for VirusTotal response structures
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to note that stats dictionaries may contain non-numeric values
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for any similar type errors in production

## Verification
To verify the fix works in production:

```bash
# Run the enrichment refresh script
uv run scripts/enrichment_refresh.py --cache-dir /mnt/dshield/data/cache

# Check for TypeError errors in logs
# Should complete without "unsupported operand type" errors
```

## Summary
This fix ensures that sum operations on VirusTotal statistics dictionaries are robust against non-numeric values that may be present due to serialization of complex vt-py objects. The fix is minimal, defensive, and maintains backward compatibility.
