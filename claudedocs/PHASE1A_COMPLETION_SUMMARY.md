## What Was Created

### 1. SQL Analysis Queries (800+ lines)
**File**: `scripts/phase1/sql_analysis_queries.sql`

10 comprehensive PostgreSQL queries designed to identify discriminative features for threat actor clustering:

| Query | Purpose | Expected Output | Priority |
|-------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| 01 | Command Diversity Analysis | ~100-500 rows | High |
| 02 | TTP Sequence Patterns (N-grams) | ~200-1000 rows | High |
| 03 | Temporal Attack Patterns | ~168 rows (24h×7d) | Medium |
| 04 | ASN Infrastructure Clustering | ~50-200 rows | High |
| **05** | **SSH Key Reuse (GOLD MINE)** | ~50-200 rows | **CRITICAL** |
| 06 | Password List Analysis | ~100-500 rows | Medium |
| 07 | Persistence Techniques (MITRE) | ~365 rows | High |
| 08 | Credential Access (MITRE) | ~365 rows | High |
| 09 | Reconnaissance (MITRE) | ~365 rows | High |
| 10 | Campaign Correlation Matrix | ~500 rows | High |

**Key Features**:
- PGAdmin-ready format (copy-paste execution)
- CSV export instructions included
- Execution time estimates provided
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings for queries 7-9
- Focus on user priorities: Persistence, Credential Injection, Recon

### 2. Feature Importance Analyzer (700+ lines)
**File**: `scripts/phase1/analyze_feature_importance.py`

Python script that processes SQL query CSV results and calculates discrimination scores:

**Statistical Measures**:
- **Variance Score** (30% weight): Inter-campaign variability
- **Mutual Information** (40% weight): Information gain about campaign identity
- **Chi-Square Test** (30% weight): Independence from campaign identity

**Output**: Ranked list of features with combined discrimination score (0-1)

**Features**:
- Handles missing CSV files gracefully
- Progress reporting with `--verbose` flag
- Configurable top-N feature selection
- Comprehensive Markdown report generation
- Type-safe with full docstrings

### 3. Quick Start Guide
**File**: `docs/phase1/PHASE1A_QUICKSTART.md`

Step-by-step instructions for executing the Phase 1A.1 workflow:
1. Execute SQL queries in PGAdmin (30 min)
2. Run Python analysis script (5 min)
3. Review feature discovery report (15 min)
4. Validate feature count and proceed to Phase 1A.2

**Timeline**: 50 minutes total for Phase 1A.1 completion

## What You Need to Do Next

### Action Required: Execute SQL Queries (30 minutes)

You have database access and can run these queries in PGAdmin:

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Open `scripts/phase1/sql_analysis_queries.sql`
2. Create local results directory: `mkdir -p results/`
3. For each of the 10 queries:
   - Copy query from file
   - Paste into PGAdmin query window
   - Execute (queries run from 1 second to 2 minutes each)
   - Export results to CSV: `results/01_command_diversity.csv`, etc.
4. Run Python analysis:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/phase1/analyze_feature_importance.py --verbose
   ```
5. Review output: `docs/phase1/feature_discovery_analysis.md`

**Database Connection**:
Use `config/sensors.toml` for connection details (PostgreSQL 10.130.30.89)

### Expected Outcomes

After running the analysis, you'll have:

✅ **Feature Discovery Report** with:
- Total features analyzed (estimated 60-100 features)
- Top 20-40 features ranked by discrimination score
- Category breakdown (TTP, Temporal, Infrastructure, Credential, MITRE)
- Recommendations for Phase 1B implementation

✅ **Data-Driven Feature Count**: No more "thumb in the wind" - statistical validation

✅ **SSH Key Insights**: Query 5 results will show persistent actors tracked via SSH key fingerprints

✅ **MITRE Technique Patterns**: Queries 7-9 map commands to your priority areas (Persistence, Credential Access, Recon)

## Phase 1A Architecture

### Current State (Phase 1A.1)
```
[Production Database]
         ↓
    [SQL Queries] ← scripts/phase1/sql_analysis_queries.sql
         ↓
    [CSV Results] → results/*.csv (10 files)
         ↓
[Python Analysis] ← scripts/phase1/analyze_feature_importance.py
         ↓
  [MD Report] → docs/phase1/feature_discovery_analysis.md
```

### Next Phases

**Phase 1A.2** (pending): Analyze SSH Persistent Campaign
- Input: Your writeups on massive SSH campaign
- Output: Known actor TTP template
- Seed database with known threat actor

**Phase 1B**: Implement MITRE Mapper
- Build `cowrieprocessor/ttp/mitre_mapper.py`
- Map top command patterns to MITRE techniques
- Create technique sequence fingerprints

**Phase 1C**: Random Forest Training
- Feature engineering with top 20-40 features
- Semi-supervised learning with analyst feedback
- Target: Recall ≥0.85, Precision ≥0.70, F1 ≥0.75

## Technical Details

### SQL Query Design

**Query 5 (SSH Key Reuse) - Why It's a Gold Mine**:
```sql
SELECT
    ssh_key_fingerprint,
    ssh_key_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT src_ip) as unique_ips,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(start_time)) as days_active,
    MAX(start_time) - MIN(start_time) as campaign_duration
FROM session_summaries
WHERE ssh_key_fingerprint IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ssh_key_fingerprint, ssh_key_type
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT src_ip) >= 3
ORDER BY unique_ips DESC;
```

**Why**: SSH keys are expensive to generate and difficult to change. Attackers reuse them across campaigns, making this the **strongest actor fingerprint signal**.

**Expected**: 50-200 unique SSH keys, each potentially representing a distinct threat actor or campaign.

### Python Analysis Algorithm

**Discrimination Score Formula**:
```python
discrimination_score = (
    0.3 * variance_normalized +      # Inter-campaign variability
    0.4 * mutual_information +       # Information gain
    0.3 * chi_square_normalized      # Statistical independence
)
```

**Thresholds**:
- **≥0.7**: Excellent discrimination (definitely include)
- **0.6-0.7**: Good discrimination (likely include)
- **<0.6**: Low discrimination (consider excluding)

**Feature Categories**:
1. **TTP Sequences** (10-15 features): Command N-grams, technique patterns
2. **Temporal Behavioral** (5-8 features): Attack velocity, timing patterns
3. **Infrastructure Fingerprints** (5-8 features): ASN, SSH keys, IP rotation
4. **Credential Strategies** (5-8 features): Password entropy, username patterns
5. **MITRE Techniques** (5-8 features): Persistence, Credential Access, Recon

**Target**: 20-40 total features (data-driven, not arbitrary)

## Questions Answered

### "We don't want to overfeature or under feature"
✅ **Solution**: Statistical analysis with discrimination scores (0-1) identifies optimal features objectively

### "64 was a thumb in the wind, we should develop a process"
✅ **Solution**: Created data-driven process using variance, mutual information, chi-square tests

### "We can label as many as you think are useful"
✅ **Solution**: Phase 1C will use semi-supervised learning + analyst feedback loop for iterative labeling

### "We are looking to identify players by unique sequences of TTP's"
✅ **Solution**: Query 2 (TTP sequences) + Queries 7-9 (MITRE techniques) specifically target this

### "Persistence, Credential injection, and recon are my primary interests"
✅ **Solution**: Queries 7-9 focus exclusively on these MITRE categories with technique-specific detection

1. **Review**: I'll review the feature discovery analysis report you generate
2. **Phase 1A.2**: Analyze your SSH persistent campaign writeups to create known actor template
3. **Phase 1B Planning**: Design MITRE ATT&CK mapper implementation
4. **Feature Engineering**: Begin implementing top features in production code

---

**Status Summary**: Phase 1A.1 tools complete and ready for execution. All scripts tested locally with mock data. Awaiting production database query execution to generate feature discovery analysis report.

**Estimated Remaining Time**: 50 minutes (30m SQL + 5m Python + 15m review)

**Next Action**: Execute SQL queries in PGAdmin and run Python analysis script

**Blocker**: None (you have database access and scripts are ready)
