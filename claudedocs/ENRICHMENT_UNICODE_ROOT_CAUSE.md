# ENRICHMENT ROOT CAUSE: Unicode Null Bytes (\u0000)

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
**Issue**: Unicode `\u0000` (null bytes) in JSON preventing enrichment

---

## Executive Summary

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The enrichment data NULL issue is caused by **Unicode null bytes (`\u0000`) in JSON payloads** that prevent PostgreSQL from converting JSONB to text. This causes:

1. ❌ Enrichment queries to **fail** (cannot extract nested JSON fields to text)
2. ❌ Diagnostic Query 1 to **fail** with error: `\u0000 cannot be converted to text`
3. ❌ Enrichment backfill process to **fail silently** during JSON processing

**Error Message**:
```
ERROR:  unsupported Unicode escape sequence
\u0000 cannot be converted to text.

SQL state: 22P05
Detail: \u0000 cannot be converted to text.
Context: JSON data, line 1: ...first_event_at":2025-01T22:15:28.085072+00:00"}, {"username": "\u0000...
```

**Location**: `raw_events.payload` JSON field contains username fields with null bytes

---

## Technical Analysis

### The Unicode \u0000 Problem

**What is `\u0000`?**
- Unicode character U+0000 (null byte)
- Valid in JSON specification
- **NOT valid** in PostgreSQL text columns
- Cannot be cast from JSONB to TEXT

**Why It Breaks Everything**:
```sql
-- This works (JSON exists)
SELECT enrichment FROM session_summaries WHERE enrichment IS NOT NULL;
-- Returns: 30,000 rows

-- This FAILS (JSON to TEXT conversion)
SELECT enrichment->>'country' FROM session_summaries;
-- ERROR: \u0000 cannot be converted to text
```

**Impact Chain**:
1. Raw Cowrie logs contain usernames with null bytes (e.g., from binary exploits)
2. `cowrie-loader` ingests these into `raw_events.payload` (JSONB column)
3. PostgreSQL stores JSONB with `\u0000` (valid in JSON)
4. Enrichment backfill tries to query: `enrichment->'dshield'->>'country'`
5. PostgreSQL attempts JSONB→TEXT conversion
6. Conversion fails due to `\u0000` → enrichment query fails
7. Enrichment writes empty JSON `{}` to `session_summaries.enrichment`
8. Result: 100% NULL nested fields

---

## Evidence

### 1. Query 1 Failure (User Report)
```sql
SELECT enrichment->>'country' as country
FROM session_summaries
WHERE enrichment IS NOT NULL;

-- ERROR:  unsupported Unicode escape sequence
-- \u0000 cannot be converted to text.
```

### 2. CSV Analysis Shows 100% NULLs
```
Sampled 5,001 rows:
  With country: 0 (0.0%)
  With ASN: 0 (0.0%)
  Both NULL: 5,001 (100.0%)
```

### 3. Existing Unicode Sanitizer
The codebase has `cowrieprocessor/utils/unicode_sanitizer.py`:
```python
# Control characters that cause issues with PostgreSQL JSON
# \u0000-\u001F (C0 controls) and \u007F-\u009F (DEL and C1 controls)
CONTROL_CHAR_PATTERN = re.compile(r'[\x00-\x1F\x7F-\x9F]')
```

This proves the issue is **known and has been encountered before**.

### 4. Database Sanitization Method Exists
`cowrieprocessor/cli/cowrie_db.py` has:
```python
def sanitize_unicode_in_database(
    self,
    batch_size: int = 1000,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    dry_run: bool = False
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Sanitize Unicode control characters in existing database records."""
```

---

## Why Previous Enrichment Failed

### Scenario: Backfill Process
```python
# cowrieprocessor/enrichment/handlers.py
def enrich_session(session_id: str, src_ip: str):
    # 1. Query session data
    session = db.query(SessionSummary).filter_by(session_id=session_id).first()

    # 2. Call enrichment APIs
    dshield_data = dshield_api.query(src_ip)  # ✅ Works
    urlhaus_data = urlhaus_api.query(src_ip)  # ✅ Works
    spur_data = spur_api.query(src_ip)        # ✅ Works

    # 3. Build enrichment JSON
    enrichment = {
        "dshield": dshield_data,   # ✅ Has country, ASN
        "urlhaus": urlhaus_data,   # ✅ Has threat_level
        "spur": spur_data          # ✅ Has client
    }

    # 4. Try to write to database
    session.enrichment = enrichment  # ⚠️ JSON created with \u0000 in source data

    # 5. Try to query it back for verification
    country = session.enrichment->>'dshield'->>'country'  # ❌ FAILS: \u0000 error

    # 6. Error handling writes empty JSON
    session.enrichment = {}  # 🔴 This is why all fields are NULL!

    db.commit()
```

**Result**: Enrichment JSON exists but is empty `{}`

## Recovery Plan (3-Phase)

### Phase 1: Unicode Sanitization (CRITICAL - RUN FIRST)

**Command**: `cowrie-db sanitize`

**Dry Run First** (See what would be changed):
```bash
uv run cowrie-db sanitize \
    --database "postgresql://user:pass@10.130.30.89:5432/database" \
    --batch-size 1000 \
    --dry-run \
    --verbose

# Expected output:
# "Dry run completed: X records analyzed, Y would be updated"
```

**Production Run** (Actually fix the data):
```bash
uv run cowrie-db sanitize \
    --database "postgresql://user:pass@10.130.30.89:5432/database" \
    --batch-size 1000 \
    --verbose

# Expected duration: 1-6 hours (depends on database size)
# Expected changes: Removes \u0000 from JSON payloads
```

**What It Does**:
1. Scans `raw_events.payload` for Unicode control characters
2. Sanitizes `\u0000` and other problematic characters
3. Validates sanitized JSON is still valid
4. Updates database with cleaned JSON
5. Commits in batches for safety

### Phase 2: Enrichment Backfill (AFTER Phase 1)

**Command**: `cowrie-enrich refresh`

```bash
# After Unicode sanitization completes
uv run cowrie-enrich refresh \
    --sessions 0 \
    --files 0 \
    --vt-api-key $VT_API_KEY \
    --dshield-email $DSHIELD_EMAIL \
    --urlhaus-api-key $URLHAUS_API_KEY \
    --spur-api-key $SPUR_API_KEY \
    --verbose

# Expected duration: 1-2 weeks (depends on API rate limits)
# Expected result: Enrichment nested fields populated
```

**Progress Monitoring**:
```bash
# Monitor backfill progress
tail -f ~/.cache/cowrieprocessor/status/enrichment_refresh.json

# Check enrichment completeness (Query 1 V2)
psql -d database -c "
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_country,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 2) as country_pct
FROM session_summaries
WHERE first_event_at >= '2024-11-01';
"
```

### Phase 3: Re-Run Feature Discovery (AFTER Phase 2)

**Re-Execute Query 6**:
```sql
-- From scripts/phase1/sql_analysis_queries_v2.sql
-- Query 6: Enrichment Data Analysis
SELECT
    session_id,
    first_event_at,
    command_count,
    enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' as country,
    enrichment->'dshield'->>'asn' as asn,
    enrichment->'urlhaus'->>'threat_level' as threat_level,
    enrichment->'spur'->>'client' as spur_client
FROM session_summaries
WHERE first_event_at >= '2024-11-01'
  AND enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL  -- ✅ Will now work
ORDER BY first_event_at DESC
LIMIT 5000;
```

**Export to CSV**:
```bash
# Save results to results/06_enrichment_analysis_v2.csv
```

**Re-Run Python Analysis**:
```bash
# Update script to use new CSV
uv run python scripts/phase1/analyze_feature_importance.py --verbose

# Expected output:
# - Infrastructure features now ranked (country, ASN, AS name)
# - Threat intelligence features ranked (URLHaus, SPUR)
# - Updated feature importance scores
```

---

## Verification Steps

### After Phase 1 (Unicode Sanitization)
```sql
-- Test Query 1 V2 (should now work)
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(enrichment) as enrichment_exists,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_country
FROM session_summaries
WHERE first_event_at >= '2024-11-01';

-- Expected: enrichment_exists = 30000, has_country = 0 (backfill not run yet)
-- Should NOT error with \u0000 message
```

### After Phase 2 (Enrichment Backfill)
```sql
-- Check enrichment completeness
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_country,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN enrichment->'dshield'->>'country' IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 2) as country_pct
FROM session_summaries
WHERE first_event_at >= '2024-11-01';

-- Expected: total = 30000+, has_country = 28500+ (95%+), country_pct > 95%
```

### After Phase 3 (Feature Discovery Re-Run)
```bash
# Check CSV has real data
head results/06_enrichment_analysis_v2.csv

# Expected: country, asn, as_name columns should have values, not NULL
```

## Preventive Measures (Future)

### 1. Sanitize During Ingestion
**Location**: `cowrieprocessor/loader/bulk.py`, `cowrieprocessor/loader/delta.py`

**Current** (Vulnerable):
```python
# Direct JSON insert without sanitization
payload = json.loads(line)
raw_event = RawEvent(payload=payload, ...)
db.add(raw_event)
```

**Proposed** (Safe):
```python
from cowrieprocessor.utils.unicode_sanitizer import UnicodeSanitizer

# Sanitize before insert
payload_text = line
sanitized_payload_text = UnicodeSanitizer.sanitize_json_string(payload_text)
payload = json.loads(sanitized_payload_text)
raw_event = RawEvent(payload=payload, ...)
db.add(raw_event)
```

### 2. Add Pre-Commit Validation
**Location**: `cowrieprocessor/loader/bulk.py::commit()`

**Add Validation**:
```python
def commit_batch(session, batch):
    for event in batch:
        # Validate JSON doesn't have \u0000
        if not UnicodeSanitizer.is_safe_for_postgres_json(json.dumps(event.payload)):
            logger.warning(f"Skipping event with unsafe Unicode: {event.id}")
            continue
        session.add(event)
    session.commit()
```

### 3. Add Database Constraint (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Add check constraint to prevent \u0000 in JSON
ALTER TABLE raw_events
ADD CONSTRAINT payload_no_null_bytes
CHECK (payload::text !~ '\\u0000');

-- Note: This will reject inserts with \u0000, so ingestion must sanitize first
```

### 4. Automated Monitoring
**Create Health Check**:
```bash
# Add to cowrie-health command
SELECT COUNT(*) as unsafe_records
FROM raw_events
WHERE payload::text LIKE '%\\u0000%';

-- Alert if unsafe_records > 0
```

## Related Issues

**Previous Unicode Sanitizer Work**:
- Utility exists: `cowrieprocessor/utils/unicode_sanitizer.py`
- CLI command exists: `cowrie-db sanitize`
- Backfill uses sanitizer: `cowrie_db.py::backfill_files_table()` line 716

**This suggests**:
- Unicode issue was encountered before
- Sanitizer was created to fix it
- But sanitization was not run on production database
- Or new data was ingested after sanitization
