## Edge Cases Included

### 1. Single IP Attack (`edge_cases_001_20240510`)
**Purpose**: Tests minimum IP threshold for snowshoe detection
- 1 IP with high DShield reputation
- Multiple login attempts
- Should NOT cluster as snowshoe (requires distributed IPs)

### 2. Empty/Null Passwords (`edge_cases_002_20240615`)
**Purpose**: Tests password normalization in clustering
- 2 IPs using empty string and null passwords
- Identical attack pattern
- Tests data quality handling

---

## Metadata Schema

All incidents follow this canonical schema:

```json
{
  "incident_id": "{category}_{number}_{YYYYMMDD}",
  "category": "credential_stuffing|targeted_attacks|hybrid_attacks|legitimate_traffic|edge_cases",
  "date_range": {"start": "ISO8601", "end": "ISO8601"},
  "ip_count": int,
  "session_count": int,
  "attack_characteristics": {
    "password_reuse": bool,
    "username_reuse": bool,
    "geographic_spread": "local|regional|national|global",
    "temporal_pattern": "burst|sustained|sporadic|mixed",
    "command_similarity": "none|low|medium|high|identical"
  },
  "ground_truth_label": "snowshoe_spam|targeted_attack|hybrid|legitimate_traffic|unknown",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reviewer": str,
  "review_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "notes": str,
  "enrichment_coverage": {
    "virustotal": float,
    "dshield": float,
    "hibp": float
  }
}
```

**Validation**: Run `uv run python tests/fixtures/snowshoe_baseline/validate_metadata.py`

## Next Steps to Complete Issue #53

### Immediate (Reach 20 incidents)

1. **Extract from Production Database**
   ```bash
   # Configure database access
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://cowrieprocessor:...@10.130.30.89:5432/cowrieprocessor"

   # Extract 4 more of each category
   uv run python tests/fixtures/snowshoe_baseline/extract_incidents.py \
       --all-categories \
       --limit 4 \
       --days 90
   ```

2. **Manual Review & Labeling**
   - Review all 14 extracted incidents
   - Verify attack characteristics
   - Confirm ground truth labels
   - Update confidence levels
   - Add detailed notes

3. **Add More Edge Cases**
   - IPv6 attacks
   - Multi-day spanning attacks
   - No commands recorded (auth only)
   - Very high IP counts (>100)
   - Extremely slow attacks (days/weeks)

4. **Validation**
   ```bash
   uv run python tests/fixtures/snowshoe_baseline/validate_metadata.py
   uv run python tests/fixtures/snowshoe_baseline/stats.py --verbose
   ```

### Future (Issue #60 - Expand to 100+ incidents)

1. **Temporal Diversity**
   - Full year coverage (test vocabulary evolution)
   - Recent attacks (last 3 months)
   - Historical attacks (6-12 months ago)

2. **Quality Improvements**
   - Multiple reviewers for inter-rater reliability
   - Blind labeling for validation
   - External security researcher validation

3. **Category Expansion**
   - 20+ incidents per category
   - More sophisticated edge cases
   - Adversarial examples (designed to fool algorithm)

---

## Labeling Confidence Assessment

### High Confidence (4 incidents)
- **credential_stuffing_001**: Clear password reuse pattern across multiple IPs
- **targeted_attacks_001**: Single IP with malware download, VT flagged
- **hybrid_attacks_001**: Mixed snowshoe + exploitation behavior
- **legitimate_traffic_001**: Security researcher with verification commands

### Medium Confidence (2 incidents)
- **edge_cases_001**: Single IP but high DShield score (ambiguous)
- **edge_cases_002**: Low DShield scores despite distributed pattern

**Recommendation**: High-confidence incidents are suitable for baseline metrics (#54). Medium-confidence incidents require additional review or should be used for algorithm stress testing.

---

## Difficult Categorization Cases

### None Identified (Yet)

All 6 synthetic incidents have clear classification rationale. However, real production data will likely include:

1. **Slow distributed attacks**: Spans days/weeks, requires temporal clustering analysis
2. **Low IP counts near threshold**: Is 5 IPs snowshoe or targeted?
3. **Mixed legitimate/malicious**: Security scanners with malicious-looking patterns
4. **Novel attack patterns**: Behaviors not matching existing categories

**Action**: Document these as they arise during production extraction

---

## Recommendation for Expanding to 100+ Incidents

### Prioritization Strategy

**Phase 1 (20 incidents)** - IMMEDIATE
- Focus: Coverage of core categories
- Target: 5 incidents per category minimum
- Quality: High confidence labels
- Purpose: Enable baseline metrics (#54)

**Phase 2 (50 incidents)** - NEXT SPRINT
- Focus: Temporal diversity (full year)
- Target: 10 incidents per category
- Quality: Mix of high/medium confidence
- Purpose: Algorithm validation (#55)

**Phase 3 (100+ incidents)** - FUTURE
- Focus: Edge cases and adversarial examples
- Target: 20+ incidents per category
- Quality: Multiple reviewers, blind labeling
- Purpose: Robust algorithm testing, publication

### Extraction Queries by Priority

1. **High Priority** (for 20-incident baseline):
   - Credential stuffing: Last 90 days, 50-150 IPs, >100 sessions
   - Targeted attacks: Last 90 days, 10-30 IPs, malware downloads
   - Hybrid attacks: Last 90 days, VT/DShield flagged, multiple IPs
   - Legitimate traffic: Known security researchers, low session counts

2. **Medium Priority** (for 50-incident expansion):
   - Older attacks (6-12 months) for temporal testing
   - IPv6 attacks
   - Multi-day attacks
   - Very high IP counts (>200)

3. **Low Priority** (for 100+ incidents):
   - Adversarial examples (designed to fool algorithm)
   - Novel patterns not matching categories
   - International attacks (non-English commands)
