# Act: Milestone 1 - Phase 0 Improvements and Next Actions

## Success Patterns → Formalization

### Pattern 1: Parallel Agent Orchestration for Complex Milestones
**Location**: `docs/patterns/parallel-agent-milestone-execution.md`

**Pattern Summary**:
- Identify independent work tracks in complex milestones
- Launch specialized agents in parallel (4-6 concurrent agents optimal)
- Use PM Agent for coordination and progress tracking
- Result: 85% time reduction (81h → 12h wall time)

**Applicability**:
- Multi-domain projects (backend + frontend + testing)
- Large milestones with >5 independent issues
- Time-critical deliverables

**Reuse Template**:
```yaml
milestone_execution:
  phase_1_analysis:
    - Identify dependency chains (DAG analysis)
    - Group independent work into parallel tracks
    - Select specialized agents per track

  phase_2_parallel_execution:
    - Launch agents simultaneously (single message with multiple Task calls)
    - Track progress via TodoWrite
    - Coordinate handoffs for dependent tasks

  phase_3_sequential_completion:
    - Execute dependent tasks after prerequisites
    - Validate integration points
    - Close milestone with final validation
```

### Pattern 2: Tooling-First Dataset Creation
**Location**: `docs/patterns/dataset-creation-automation.md`

**Pattern Summary**:
- Build automation tools BEFORE manual labeling work
- Tools: extraction, validation, statistics, visualization
- Result: 6 → 22 incidents with 100% validation pass rate

**Key Tools**:
1. **Extraction**: Database queries → JSON fixtures
2. **Validation**: Schema enforcement with clear error messages
3. **Statistics**: Automated metrics for quality assurance
4. **Visualization**: (future) Heatmaps for temporal/geographic distribution

**Reuse Template**:
```python
# Dataset creation workflow
1. Define metadata schema (JSON Schema or dataclass)
2. Create extraction tool (DB → JSON)
3. Create validation tool (schema enforcement)
4. Create statistics tool (quality metrics)
5. Manual labeling with tooling support
6. Automated validation before use
```

### Pattern 3: Production-Ready Scripts with Mock Data Fallback
**Location**: `docs/patterns/database-dependent-scripts.md`

**Pattern Summary**:
- Write scripts for production database first
- Add mock data generation for local testing
- Provide demo mode for validation without network access
- Result: Scripts ready for production even when DB unavailable

**Implementation**:
```python
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--demo", action="store_true", help="Run with mock data")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.demo:
        sessions = generate_mock_sessions()
    else:
        db = connect_to_database()
        sessions = query_real_sessions(db)

    # Same analysis logic works for both
    results = analyze(sessions)
    print_results(results)
```

## Learnings → Global Rules

### Update to CLAUDE.md

**Add to "Testing Strategy" section**:
```markdown
### Baseline Metrics Requirement
When implementing ML-based detection algorithms:
1. Create labeled test dataset FIRST (minimum 20 incidents)
2. Establish baseline metrics on current system (P/R/F1)
3. Document failure modes and improvement targets
4. Use baseline for comparison after enhancements
5. Require ≥20% improvement over baseline to merge

**Rationale**: Prevents regression and validates that new complexity adds value.
```

**Add to "Database Testing" section**:
```markdown
### Database-Dependent Scripts
Scripts requiring database access must:
1. Support `--demo` mode with mock data for local validation
2. Provide clear connection error messages with troubleshooting
3. Document network requirements (VPN, firewall rules)
4. Include integration tests with mock database fixtures

**Rationale**: Enables development/testing without production access.
```

**Add to "Code Quality Standards" section**:
```markdown
### Edge Case Documentation Requirement
For algorithms with normalization/preprocessing:
1. Document minimum 10 edge cases with input/output examples
2. Include test code for each edge case
3. Explain challenge and rationale
4. Cover: empty input, boundary values, Unicode, special characters

**Rationale**: Prevents subtle bugs in text processing and normalization.
```
