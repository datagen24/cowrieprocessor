# Milestone 1: Snowshoe Enhancement - Phase 0 Execution Plan

## Overview
**Goal**: Complete critical blockers for Phase 1 readiness
**Scope**: Defanging normalization, test datasets, baseline metrics, feature extraction validation
**Total Issues**: 13 (all open)
**Estimated Effort**: ~123 hours total

## Priority Breakdown
- **P0 Critical**: 7 issues (60 hours) - Must complete first
- **P1 High**: 3 issues (15 hours) - Block future work  
- **P2 Medium**: 2 issues (48 hours) - Can defer to later

## Dependency Chains
1. **Defanging Track**: #50 → #51 → #52
2. **Dataset Track**: #53 → #54, #60 → #61
3. **Feature Track**: #55 → #56 → #57 → #58
4. **Independent**: #59 (batch size calculation)

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: P0 Critical Blockers (Parallel Tracks)

**Track A: Defanging Normalization** (18h total)
- #50: Implement DefangingAwareNormalizer (8h) - python-expert
- #51: Document Edge Cases (4h) - technical-writer
- #52: Execute Consistency Tests (6h) - quality-engineer

**Track B: MVP Dataset & Baseline** (24h total)
- #53: Create MVP Test Dataset (16h) - quality-engineer + deep-research-agent
- #54: Establish Baseline Metrics (8h) - quality-engineer

**Track C: Provider Classification & Features** (18h total)
- #55: Dynamic Provider Classification (12h) - backend-architect
- #56: Feature Aggregation Helpers (6h) - python-expert

**Track D: Batch Size Configuration** (3h total)
- #59: Batch Size Auto-Calculation (3h) - backend-architect

### Phase 2: P1 High Priority Validation (15h total)
- #57: Test Feature Extraction on 50+ Sessions (6h) - quality-engineer
- #58: Run Feature Independence Analysis (6h) - performance-engineer
- (Parallel to Phase 1 Track D, can start earlier)

### Phase 3: P2 Medium Priority (48h total)
- #60: Complete Test Dataset (100+ incidents) (40h) - Deferred
- #61: Complete Baseline Metrics (8h) - Deferred

## Agent Delegation Plan

### Immediate Parallel Execution (Phase 1)
1. **python-expert**: #50 DefangingAwareNormalizer + #56 Aggregation helpers
2. **backend-architect**: #55 Provider classification + #59 Batch size
3. **quality-engineer**: #53 MVP dataset + #54 Baseline metrics + #52 Tests
4. **technical-writer**: #51 Edge case documentation

### Sequential (Phase 2)
5. **quality-engineer**: #57 Feature testing (after #55, #56)
6. **performance-engineer**: #58 Independence analysis (after #57)

### Deferred (Phase 3)
7. **quality-engineer** + **deep-research-agent**: #60, #61

## Success Criteria
- All P0 issues closed
- All P1 issues closed
- MVP dataset validated
- Baseline metrics established
- Feature extraction validated
- Tests passing with >65% coverage
