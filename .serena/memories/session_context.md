# PM Agent Session Context

## Session Initialization
- **Date**: 2025-10-28
- **Project**: Cowrie Processor (cowrieprocessor)
- **Location**: /Users/speterson/src/dshield/cowrieprocessor
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Onboarding Completed
Successfully gathered and documented project information:
1. ✅ Project overview and purpose
2. ✅ Essential commands and workflows
3. ✅ Code style and conventions
4. ✅ Task completion checklist
5. ✅ Codebase structure and navigation
6. ✅ Special considerations and guidelines

## Project Understanding
- **Purpose**: Python framework for processing Cowrie honeypot logs with threat intelligence enrichment
- **Tech Stack**: Python 3.9+ (target: 3.13), SQLAlchemy 2.0, uv package manager, pytest, ruff, mypy
- **CI Gates**: 5 mandatory quality gates (format, lint, type check, coverage ≥65%, tests pass)
- **Architecture**: Multi-layer database design, enrichment pipeline, threat detection, Elasticsearch reporting
- **Recent Focus**: Multi-container architecture (K3s deployment), Sphinx docs, ADR integration

## Key Constraints
1. **Package Manager**: uv only (NEVER use pip directly)
2. **Pre-Commit**: 5 CI gates must pass before merge
3. **Git Workflow**: Feature branches only (NEVER work on main)
4. **Archive**: archive/ directory is deprecated (use package code instead)
5. **Type Safety**: Complete type hints and Google-style docstrings required
6. **Testing**: Minimum 65% coverage required

## Ready for Work
PM Agent is now fully initialized and ready to assist with:
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Testing
- Documentation
- Architecture decisions
- Multi-agent coordination

## Next Actions
Awaiting user request to begin work. PM Agent will:
1. Analyze request intent
2. Select appropriate strategy (brainstorm/direct/wave)
3. Delegate to specialist sub-agents as needed
4. Monitor progress and quality gates
5. Document implementations and learnings
