# Milestone 1: Phase 0 Progress Report

## Completion Status: 64% (9/14 tasks)

### ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

**Track A: Defanging Normalization** (3/3 complete)
- ✅ #50: DefangingAwareNormalizer (99% coverage, 19 tests)
- ✅ #51: Edge Case Documentation (15 cases documented)
- ✅ #52: Vocabulary Consistency Tests (16/16 passing, 82K cmd/sec)

**Track C: Provider Classification & Features** (2/2 complete)
- ✅ #55: Dynamic Provider Classification (96% coverage, 24 tests)
- ✅ #56: Feature Aggregation Helpers (88% coverage, 35 tests)

**Track D: Batch Size** (1/1 complete)
- ✅ #59: Auto-Calculation (85% coverage, 29 tests)

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Track B: Dataset & Baseline** (1/2 in progress)
- 🔄 #53: MVP Test Dataset (6/20 incidents created, tooling ready)
- ⏳ #54: Baseline Metrics (blocked by #53)

### ⏳ PENDING (Phase 2)

**Feature Validation** (0/2 pending)
- ⏳ #57: Test Feature Extraction (50+ sessions) - Ready to start
- ⏳ #58: Feature Independence Analysis - Depends on #57

### 📊 Deferred (Phase 3 - Post-Milestone)

- ⏹️ #60: Complete Test Dataset (100+ incidents) - 40 hours
- ⏹️ #61: Complete Baseline Metrics - 8 hours

## Quality Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: 85-99% across all modules (target: 65%+)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (all 157 tests passing)
- **Performance**: All benchmarks under thresholds
- **Quality Gates**: All passing (ruff, mypy, pytest)

## Next Critical Path

1. Expand MVP dataset to 20 incidents (#53)
2. Establish baseline metrics (#54)
3. Run feature validation tests (#57, #58)
4. Close milestone with final validation

## Time Remaining

- **Estimated**: ~30 hours (dataset expansion + baseline + validation)
- **Parallelizable**: Dataset expansion can overlap with feature validation
- **Critical Path**: #53 → #54 → Milestone closure
