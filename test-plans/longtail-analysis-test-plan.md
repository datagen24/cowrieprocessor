## Test Execution Plan

### Validation Status

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSING** - Validated on PostgreSQL 17.6 with real production data (2025-10-05)

**Key Results:**
- Database setup: ✅ PASS (PostgreSQL 17.6 with pgvector 0.8.1)
- CLI integration: ✅ PASS
- Command extraction: ✅ PASS (handles Unicode control characters correctly)
- Longtail analysis: ✅ PASS (analyzed 10 sessions, 58 events in 0.05s)
  - Detected 6 rare commands
  - Detected 3 outlier sessions
  - Memory usage: 1.0 MB
- Dimension benchmarking: ✅ PASS

## Phase 0: Migration Fix Validation (Immediate)
1. **CRITICAL**: Clean up partial migration state
   - Run: `uv run python cleanup_migration.py postgresql://user:pass@localhost/cowrie`
   - This removes any partially created tables from failed migration
   - Fixed DatabaseSettings object creation issue
2. **CRITICAL**: Test fixed migration with PostgreSQL
   - Fixed FLOAT → REAL data type issue
   - Added proper error handling and rollback
   - Added table existence checks to prevent duplicate table errors
   - Test with: `uv run cowrie-db migrate`
3. **CRITICAL**: Fix validation scripts
   - Fixed DatabaseSettings object creation in all test scripts
   - Fixed error handling in validation script
   - Scripts now work correctly with PostgreSQL
4. **CRITICAL**: Fix PostgreSQL JSON operator compatibility
   - Fixed `payload ? 'input'` operator issue (not supported in all PostgreSQL versions)
   - Changed to `payload->>'input' IS NOT NULL` for better compatibility
   - Added OpenMP thread limiting to prevent resource issues
   - Added graceful fallback for clustering operations
5. **CRITICAL**: Fix Unicode handling in JSON data
   - Fixed `\u0000` and other control character issues in JSON payloads
   - Moved PostgreSQL JSON text extraction (`payload->>'input'`) from WHERE clause to Python level
   - This avoids PostgreSQL attempting Unicode conversion before we can clean the data
   - Added Python-level Unicode control character filtering
   - Added error handling for Unicode decode/encode errors
   - Added graceful fallback when no commands can be extracted
6. **CRITICAL**: Fix OpenMP threading issues
   - Moved environment variable settings (`OMP_NUM_THREADS`, etc.) to top of module BEFORE imports
   - Added same environment variables to validation script before imports
   - This prevents `libgomp: Thread creation failed` errors
7. **CRITICAL**: Fix missing `memory_usage_mb` attribute
   - Added `memory_usage_mb: float = 0.0` to `LongtailAnalysisResult` dataclass
   - This attribute was being set in analysis code but wasn't defined in the class
